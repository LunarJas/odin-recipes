    <p>A quesadilla is a Mexican dish that consists of a tortilla filled with cheese and often other ingredients, such as meat and veggies. It is cooked on a griddle or stove. Full quesadillas feature cheese sandwiched between two flat tortillas. Half quesadillas, like the one in this recipe, is a single tortilla that has been topped with fillings and folded into a half moon shape. </p>
