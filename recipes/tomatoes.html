    <p>Fried green tomatoes are a southern favorite! And the name of a great movie! Green tomatoes are an unripe tomato with much firmer flesh and a tart flavor. They are intentionally picked early specifically for this appetizer! They are typically fried in cormeal and served alone. This dish takes about 25 minutes to make.</p>

        <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
            <p>Gather all ingredients.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
            <p>Slice the tomatoes 1/2 inch thick. Discard the ends.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
            <p>Whisk together eggs and milk in a medium-sized bowl. Scoop flour onto a plate. Mix cornmeal, bread crumbs, salt, and pepper on another plate. Dip tomatoes into milk and egg mixture; dredge in breadcrumbs to completely coat.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
            <p>Heat oil in a large deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place tomatoes in hot oil in batches of 4 or 5, to prevent them from touching; fry until crisp and golden brown on one side, then flip and fry on other side.</p>
